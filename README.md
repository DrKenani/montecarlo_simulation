# montecarlo_simulation
  Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique used to model complex systems by generating random samples to estimate outcomes. This function analyzes an input variable and automatically generates Monte Carlo simulations for the three distributions that best fit the data. It provides valuable insights into the variable's behavior, aiding in informed decision-making.
